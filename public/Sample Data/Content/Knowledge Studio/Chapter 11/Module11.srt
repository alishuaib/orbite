00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,031
In this demonstration, we will look at how a model created in Knowledge Studio can be deployed along with seeing how code nodes can be used to generate code.

2
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:13,270
To begin first create a new workflow

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,528
Link over the Validation dataset and Decision Tree model.

4
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:23,327
Drag a Scoring node found under the Action palette, onto the workflow canvas

5
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:26,096
Connect the model and dataset

6
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:29,335
Double click the node to open the wizard

7
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:33,097
Set an appropriate target name and click next

8
00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:40,098
Make sure the fields between your validation dataset and model are correctly mapped, then click next.

9
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:47,490
Adjust the cutoff values as needed, in this case we will use 0.7 and 0.3.

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,916
Select which fields to include, we're only interested in Customer ID for this demo.

11
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,946
Click run to generate the output.

12
00:00:56,946 --> 00:01:00,786
Double click the output dataset to view results.

13
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:10,269
The report gives an overview for the scored results indicating the number of records scored as Yes and No depending on the cutoff values we set earlier.

14
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:16,355
From the data tab we can see the actual scored probability for each Customer ID.

15
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:21,292
Heading back to the canvas, lets generate the model in SQL code.

16
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:27,065
Drag the generate code node onto the canvas also found under the Action palette

17
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:29,025
Connect the model

18
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:31,846
Double click to open the wizard.

19
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:42,634
Set a target name and select SQL from Code Type dropdown. Note that Knowledge Studio supports a wide array of languages to export models in.

20
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:44,280
Click run

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,295
Double click the node to view the generated code for this predictive model

22
00:01:49,295 --> 00:01:55,277
This code can be copied and used in other environments supporting the selected language.

23
00:01:55,277 --> 00:02:01,860
By utilizing these 2 main methods of deployment, models can be deployed and used with ease.
