00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,959
Weight of Evidence

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:07,549
In this demonstration we will be going over the Weight of Evidence node in Knowledge Studio.

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:18,520
Weight of Evidence is used to apply variable transformations by assigning a single number for each category or bin within each dataset field based on predictive power.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,759
To begin first create a new workflow.

5
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:24,267
Link the Census dataset.

6
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:28,473
Drag the Weight of Evidence node to the workflow canvas.

7
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:31,033
Connect the Census dataset.

8
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:39,288
Note that Weight of Evidence transformations are usually applied to only the Training dataset instead of both training and validation.

9
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:42,109
Double click to open the wizard.

10
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,434
Set an appropriate name.

11
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:49,763
Set the dependent variable to Response and target category to Yes.

12
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:53,629
Select all fields except for Customer ID .

13
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:58,932
For more advanced options, the attribute editor is also available.

14
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:00,812
Click next.

15
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:07,500
On this page you can modify optional optimization options used to generate decision trees .

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,430
Tree Color tab allows you to customize the colors used to represent predictive values.

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:19,882
Tree Configuration tab allows adjustments to the orientation and layout of the tree.

18
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:24,688
Tree node tab is used to select information shown for each node.

19
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:28,398
Tree growth lets you set stopping criteria.

20
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:33,387
Split measure is used to set measure parameters used to build the tree.

21
00:01:33,387 --> 00:01:37,958
Tree training can be used to change the split search and measure.

22
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:47,624
By default, Knowledge Studio uses optimal binning algorithms to bin numeric variables making it safe to continue without any changes.

23
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:49,505
Click next.

24
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:55,173
Now we can edit the bins manually and apply additional optimization options.

25
00:01:55,173 --> 00:02:01,103
In the top left, various buttons are available to navigate and edit splits.

26
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:12,074
The decision tree view shows splits alongside weight of evidence values. By default these bins are generated through optimal binning algorithms mentioned earlier.

27
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:19,598
Similarly, below this we have a histogram representation for each split showing the size of each bin.

28
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:28,035
On the top right we have a line chart indicating percentage of Yes and No records along with weight of evidence values per bin.

29
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:41,227
Directly below this we can see a tabular representation of each bin and various calculated statistics. The 2nd table shows entropy and information values for this variable.

30
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:50,135
Lastly on the bottom right we have various options used to apply optimization techniques specifically to the current variable splits.

31
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:59,147
As we edit the bins, we want to keep an eye out on tree splits, line chart and changes in entropy and information value.

32
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:04,293
We can navigate between splits using Next and Previous split buttons.

33
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:08,055
To go to a specific split, click Go to Split.

34
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:13,201
By default, these splits are sorted from most to least information value.

35
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:15,761
Let’s go to the last split.

36
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:28,509
Since this variable is mainly for identification, we can use erase split to remove it. Generally, variables like this should be removed at the first page, alongside Customer ID.

37
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:31,591
Next go to capital gain split.

38
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:38,461
Under “Optimization” select Monotonic and set Enforce Equal size to 0.5

39
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:40,290
Click apply.

40
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,182
To remove an applied optimization click reset.

41
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:50,399
Additionally, you can apply optimization to all splits by clicking Optimize All.

42
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:55,989
Click Edit Split to open a range editor, allowing you to modify bins.

43
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:01,449
Lastly to reset all changes made to every split, click Reset Bins.

44
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,975
Once you’re happy with your bins click next.

45
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:10,879
This helper page lets you adjust the field name extension for transformed variables.

46
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,980
You can also choose to output a transformation report.

47
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,861
Click next.

48
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:27,101
Here you can review each Weight of Evidence variable along with your final Information Value. The expressions can be exported and used later when needed.

49
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,993
After reviewing click Run to generate an output.

50
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:33,579
Double click on the output

51
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:37,811
We can see the new variables added to our Census dataset.

52
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:48,025
Heading to data tab, we can also see that each variable’s values has been transformed to a Weight of Evidence value based on the splits we created earlier.
