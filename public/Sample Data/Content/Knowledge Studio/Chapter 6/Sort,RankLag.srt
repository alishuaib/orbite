1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,112
In this demonstration, we will illustrate the “Sort Rank Lag” node in Knowledge Studio.

2
00:00:06,112 --> 00:00:11,833
This node is used to sort data, create ranking fields and lagged variables.

3
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:17,319
Drag the “Sort Rank Lag” node onto the canvas from the manipulate palette.

4
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:19,879
Connect the census dataset.

5
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:22,674
Double click to open the node.

6
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,999
Set an appropriate name.

7
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:26,879
Click next.

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:33,697
On this page we can select variables to use in sorting and additionally adjust the sorting order.

9
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:38,112
Select the Age variable and the Hours per week variable.

10
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:41,665
Set the sorting order to Descending for Age.

11
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:43,546
Click next.

12
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:48,326
This page allows us to select a sorting variable to be used to group.

13
00:00:48,326 --> 00:00:53,968
Optionally we can create a ranking field by selecting “Create Ranking Field”

14
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:59,820
This gives us the option to name the field and adjust its creation by group or not.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,261
Select age, and create a new ranking field by group.

16
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,141
Click next.

17
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:14,866
Now we can use any variables left unused in grouping to optionally create lagged variables which are used with timeseries data.

18
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:19,751
Select a variable from the list, then specify a lag value.

19
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:23,408
Additionally, you can handle missing values.

20
00:01:23,408 --> 00:01:28,737
We will not set a lagged variable since our dataset is not a timeseries.

21
00:01:28,737 --> 00:01:30,618
Click next.

22
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:36,548
Lastly, we can select which variables to include in our output dataset.

23
00:01:36,548 --> 00:01:40,545
After confirming everything is correct, click run.

24
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:43,653
Double click to open the dataset.

25
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:47,336
View the data tab with all fields selected.

26
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:55,069
We can see that the dataset is now sorted based on Age and Hours per week and we have a new field called “Age Rank”.

27
00:01:55,069 --> 00:02:03,376
The ranking is done by each age group with lowest rank given to least hours per week and highest rank given to most hours per week.
