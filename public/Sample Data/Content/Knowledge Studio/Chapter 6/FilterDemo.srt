1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,593
Filter

2
00:00:01,593 --> 00:00:05,250
This demonstration will illustrate the filter node.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,333
Firstly, create a new workflow.

4
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:11,624
Link or import the Census dataset.

5
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:16,587
Drag the Filter node from the manipulate palette onto the canvas.

6
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:19,147
Connect the Census dataset.

7
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:21,968
Double click to open the wizard.

8
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:30,563
Our goal is to filter out ages 17 to 25 and 35 to 90 while keeping the remaining age group records.

9
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,959
First, set an appropriate target name.

10
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:38,713
Next, select age as the field and use the range editor.

11
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:43,963
Click on Define Ranges under the Values column to open the range editor.

12
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:46,732
Let’s adjust our bin ranges.

13
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:52,140
Once done, select "filter out" for ranges we would like to remove.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:00,212
Click ok to confirm. This automatically generates the expression which can be edited manually if needed.

15
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:03,242
Click run to generate the output.

16
00:01:03,242 --> 00:01:05,619
Double click the output

17
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:16,146
Head to the dataset chart and select age. As seen on the chart, only age groups between 25 to 35 are left in the dataset.

18
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:20,091
This demonstration will illustrate the filter Join node.

19
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:25,106
We will use the workflow from the previous demo showing the filter node.

20
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:31,558
Next, let’s go to the canvas and see how we can get the filtered records in a separate dataset.

21
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:35,294
Drag the Filter Join node onto the canvas.

22
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:39,238
Connect both the census data and the filtered dataset.

23
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:42,060
Double click to open the wizard.

24
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,780
Select the field to match records with, in this case we want Customer ID.

25
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,038
Make sure that the census dataset is set as dataset 1.

26
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:53,919
Click next.

27
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:56,244
Set an appropriate name.

28
00:01:56,244 --> 00:02:03,140
We want to keep records from dataset 1 that don’t match in dataset 2, so let’s select Anti Join.

29
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,171
Click run to generate the output.

30
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,783
Double the output dataset.

31
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:15,679
We can see the number of records remaining after the filter join alongside the filter join method used.

32
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:19,362
Lets head to dataset chart and select age.

33
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:26,598
As we can see, the age group for 25-35 is not in this dataset just as we intended.
