1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,746
In this demonstration, we will illustrate the Pivot Table node in Knowledge Studio.

2
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:10,213
To begin create a new workflow and link the census dataset.

3
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:15,986
Drag the Pivot Table node, found under the manipulate palette, onto the canvas.

4
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:18,546
Connect the census dataset.

5
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:21,681
Double click to open the Pivot node.

6
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:24,006
Set an appropriate name.

7
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:27,454
We will assign a variable one of 3 roles:

8
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:31,555
Pivot indicates a variable will be used as columns.

9
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:35,552
Group indicates a variable will be used as rows.

10
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:41,377
Selected indicates a variable will be aggregated based on Pivot and Group roles.

11
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:45,975
Let's select sex as our Pivot, and Response as our group.

12
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:51,121
Select age as our Selected, and use the average aggregation method.

13
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:54,151
Click run to generate the output.

14
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:58,252
Double click the output node and view the data tab.

15
00:00:58,252 --> 00:01:05,018
We can see the aggregated result for age based on our selected Sex and Response variables.
