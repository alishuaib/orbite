00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,698
Knowledge Studio provides a powerful node called Variable Transform, which lets you add transformed fields to your dataset.

2
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:13,035
Let’s have a look at how we can apply variable transformations.

3
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:15,072
Missing Values

4
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:18,520
We will look at how to examine missing values.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,603
To begin, create a new workflow.

6
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:24,894
Link or Import the Census dataset.

7
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:30,641
Drag the Variable Transform node from the manipulate palette onto the canvas.

8
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:33,201
Connect the Census dataset.

9
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:36,022
Double click to open the wizard.

10
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:39,235
Set an appropriate target dataset name.

11
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:43,206
We will first look at how we can examine missing values.

12
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:48,744
Click “Calculate % Missing” to see the amount of missing values per field.

13
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:56,110
Here, we can see capital-gain has many missing values, we will handle this later in the demonstration.

14
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,413
For now, let’s apply a logarithmic transform to capital gain.

15
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:03,555
Click add field.

16
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:06,141
Set an appropriate field name.

17
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:12,750
Now we can either write the expression or we can use the function list to find our function of interest.

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,008
Let’s click functions and then select the math category.

19
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:22,729
If we scroll down we can see log, double click to add it to the expression.

20
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:29,730
The log function only accepts a numeric float value, in our case we want to use capital gain.

21
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:35,895
Again, we can either write capital gain or we can use the columns list to find it.

22
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:42,295
Click on columns and find capital gain, double click to insert it at your cursor location.

23
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:47,859
Let’s also add 1, to account for missing values we saw previously.

24
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:57,237
Before we click ok, we also want to enable “Force data to be instantiated” to ensure these transforms are written to our stored dataset.

25
00:01:57,237 --> 00:02:09,227
In this case, we want to apply this transformation to multiple fields, such as capital gain and capital loss. We can do so by clicking transform fields.

26
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:12,989
We need to select the fields we want to transform.

27
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:19,049
Next write out the expression but instead of using a specific column we use Selected Field.

28
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:22,367
Enable “Force data to be instantiated”.

29
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:26,494
Click ok to create the new transformed fields.

30
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:27,905
Binning

31
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:40,940
Let’s have a look at how we can apply variable transformations using binning. We will continue from our missing values demo. Double click to open the existing variable transform node.

32
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,321
Now, let’s create a new binning transform for the relationship variable.

33
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:49,795
Click add field and set an appropriate name.

34
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:56,012
Since binning can require complex expressions, we can use helpers to assist us.

35
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:57,945
Click helpers.

36
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:02,282
Select binning from the drop down menu and click next.

37
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:06,435
Switch to discrete transform and select relationship.

38
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:08,316
Click next.

39
00:03:08,316 --> 00:03:13,044
Using the range editor, group Husband and Wife into Married.

40
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:18,033
Group Not-in-family, Other-relative and Own-child into Other.

41
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:19,914
Click next.

42
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:25,870
Now we can see the created expression without the need of writing it out, lets click finish.

43
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,330
We can preview the transformation by clicking show data then clicking refresh.

44
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,334
Click ok to create the field.

45
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:43,032
Now let's have a look at the bins we created.
