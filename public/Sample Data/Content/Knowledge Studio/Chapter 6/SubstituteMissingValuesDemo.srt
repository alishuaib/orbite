00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,690
Substitute Missing Values

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,418
This demonstration will illustrate the Substitute Missing Values node.

3
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:12,120
First, create a new workflow and link the Census dataset.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,808
Let’s begin by dragging the Substitute Missing Values node onto the canvas from the manipulate palette

5
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:24,110
Connect the census dataset. Double click the Census dataset.

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,488
Click “Calculate all”.

7
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:32,992
We can see which fields have missing values. In this case it is only capital gain.

8
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:38,164
Click the data tab and select “capital gain” and observe the null values.

9
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:44,120
Head back to the workflow canvas and double click the substitute missing values node.

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,445
Set an appropriate name.

11
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:53,498
Under “Missing Values Substitution” we can select the substitution method to use for each data type.

12
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:59,193
Since “capital gain” is numeric, we are only concerned with the first data type.

13
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:08,048
We want to indicate null values are equivalent to zero gain. To do so, let’s select the “Zero” method for Numeric.

14
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:12,515
Next, let’s select “capital gain” from the field list.

15
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:15,545
Click run to generate the output.

16
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:19,412
Double click the output and click “Calculate All”.

17
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:28,345
The “number of Missing Values” column for “capital gain” now shows 0 indicating we’ve successfully substituted the missing values.

18
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:32,029
Head to the data tab and select “capital gain”

19
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:37,123
As we can see, the null values have been substituted with zero.
