1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,373
In this demonstration we’ll be going over the Text Transform block found under the Data Preparation palette.

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:11,885
To begin, first drag the “transaction V2” excel file onto the canvas.

3
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:15,621
Configure the block then click apply and close.

4
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:23,875
Double clicking on the dataset, we can see the number of observations are 3386 and this dataset has 11 variables.

5
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:32,130
We will be transforming the category variable, going to the charts tab and selecting category we can see all the category values displayed.

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,459
Let’s head back to our workflow and drag a Text Transform block onto the canvas.

7
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:42,083
Connect the dataset and double click to open the configuration.

8
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,374
First, we need to add an operation.

9
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:49,815
In input variable select our target variable “Category”

10
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:54,569
And for Output variable input a name to be used for the new variable.

11
00:00:54,569 --> 00:01:01,257
Under Operation input “backslash percentage” to use it as our selector and select Regular Expression.

12
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:06,533
Looking at the preview we can see some 1’s, indicating this operation is working.

13
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:10,008
Now let’s go ahead and remove these symbols.

14
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:13,743
Clicking on the plus sign we can add a new operation.

15
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:21,371
From input variable select Category once more but this time keep the Output variable Category as well so we can overwrite it.

16
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:26,099
Under Operation select Remove and select Pattern for Remove.

17
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:29,861
For find use the same expression as previously.

18
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:34,119
As we can see in the preview the percentage signs have been removed

19
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:41,929
One thing to note is that while it seems alright right now, the names still have a whitespace at the start, it’s only the preview not displaying it.

20
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:45,194
To fix this, add a new operation.

21
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:49,296
Again, select Category for input and output.

22
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:54,128
Under operation select remove and from this time select whitespace.

23
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:59,692
Select leading whitespace, this will ensure the variables have no space at the start

24
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:09,201
Now if we look at the chart again, we can see that some values have upper case letters while others have lower case letters. We want to standardize that.

25
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:14,034
To do so first add a new operation, select the same variable.

26
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:22,680
Under operation select Change Case and select lower case. As we can see in preview now every value is lower case.

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,964
Going back to the chart we can also see there are some spelling errors.

28
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:31,927
Let’s create a new operation and once more select the same variables.

29
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:40,313
For operation select Replace, for Find, enter the incorrectly spelled word and for Replace, enter the correctly spelled word, “lighting.”

30
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:43,395
As the preview shows it’s been fixed.

31
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:50,527
Going back to the dataset we can see there are some categories that are very similar to one another and can be grouped together.

32
00:02:50,527 --> 00:03:03,718
Add a new operation, with same variables. Select replace once more but this time for Find. input “DIY” with an asterisk which indicates finding all values that start with DIY.

33
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:08,891
For replace input the name we want to group them under, in this case just DIY.

34
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,895
Let’s do the same for the word “bath”.

35
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:24,642
Now if we save our text transform block with Ctrl + S and head back to the workflow. We can see here it’s run successfully, double clicking the output dataset and going to charts then selecting category.

36
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:29,762
We can see there are a lot fewer categories thanks the transform operations.
