1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,407
The Merge block can be used to merge all observations from both transactional files.

2
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:17,319
The Merge block is dragged onto the Workflow canvas. Notice the configuration status messages: Block requires at least two dataset inputs and: No merge operation selected.

3
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:24,581
The imported files are renamed to Jan and Feb respectively, and then connected to the join block and as a result

4
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:30,380
There is now only one configuration status message: No merge operation selected.

5
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:39,993
The Merge block is double-clicked to access its configuration dialog. Options are included to select the merge operation and a "By Variable".

6
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:47,829
Both connected datasets are listed and the available merge operations are: concatenate, interleave, and "one to one."

7
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:57,782
Concatenate stacks observations from one file on top of the other. Missing values may result if some variables that are present in only one file.

8
00:00:57,782 --> 00:01:04,313
Interleave works on a observation index and requires a "by variable" as indicated by the error message.

9
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:12,384
One or more by variables can be included, and will result in an output dataset ordered by the by variable, in this instance ID.

10
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:18,184
The one-to-one option is based on observation row index and does not use a by variable.

11
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:24,714
The first file is used as a base, if there are additional variables in other file(s), they will be added.

12
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:28,763
Values used are taken by matching row index number.

13
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:36,965
The number of observations in the final file is equal to the number of observations in the smallest input dataset, here 1215.

14
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:45,351
Choosing to include excess rows will results in a file size equal to the largest connected dataset and some observations will have missing values.

15
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:54,259
The appropriate option to use here is concatenate, which does not require a by variable. OK is clicked and the process runs.

16
00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:03,950
Opening the resulting dataset with the Data Profiler, it can be seen there are 3735 observations and four variables, as expected.

17
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:11,525
Viewing the data, 1215 January observations appear first, followed by 2520 February observations.
