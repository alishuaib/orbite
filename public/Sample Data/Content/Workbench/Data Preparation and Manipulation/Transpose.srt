00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,694
This demonstration goes over the Transpose block found under the data preparation palette.

2
00:00:05,694 --> 00:00:13,008
We’re starting by importing 3 datasets for January, February and March followed by merging them into one dataset.

3
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:19,853
Looking at the dataset we can see there are some variables such as ID, number of products, total price and month.

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:24,685
Our goal is to display the total prices per month based on the unique ID.

5
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:29,805
For the merge block configuration, the operation is set to Concatenate.

6
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:33,828
As a result, we have a dataset will all 3 months.

7
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:38,739
Now drag a transpose block onto the canvas and connect the dataset.

8
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,448
Double click to open the configuration window.

9
00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:47,072
First select the transpose type, we will select rows to columns.

10
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:54,334
In group by we will select ID, so each distinct customer ID we want the months transposed and display total price.

11
00:00:54,334 --> 00:01:02,719
Under the transpose variables section, for Column ID, select Month. For variables select total price.

12
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,414
As we can see in the preview, the total prices per month are displayed for each unique ID.

13
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:12,515
Here we can change the prefix, let’s set it to “Price_”.

14
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:20,065
Once we’re done hit CTRL + S to save. Going back to the workflow and viewing the output dataset.

15
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:24,662
We can see the data has been successfully transformed as intended.
