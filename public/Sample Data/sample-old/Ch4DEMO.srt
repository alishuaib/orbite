1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
All the steps of

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,325
the wizard soap
a click modify

3
00:00:05,325 --> 00:00:09,555
to just go back
to the wizard.

4
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:14,025
All the previous
settings already saved.

5
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:16,155
So I don't need to modify

6
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:19,650
the source file name
or target data set.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,270
If you want to change
the target data

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,550
same, you can do so.

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,000
If you have any
specific encoding,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,550
like your data has a
specific encoding to

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,340
follow a bunch
of them here.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,180
Usually, auto detect
works very well.

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,875
I recommend to
always double check,

14
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,290
make sure that your data

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,814
looks fine after importing.

16
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:48,440
So when I click next
to the next page,

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,300
gives me an overview of

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,865
how my file looks like.

19
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:53,930
It's about, I don't know,

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,570
like top 20 rolls

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,540
or top 15 rolls
of their data.

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,960
Show it shows me the
file is delimited.

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,615
The first row if the title,

24
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:07,970
as it's already checked.

25
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,180
Knowledges studios
have the ability

26
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,685
to read fixed split phi.

27
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:16,070
So if you have
fixed bit files,

28
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,355
you can also import it

29
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:19,790
into knowledges do deal.

30
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,724
You can change
that a delimited,

31
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:24,080
This is again
auto detected,

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,300
but as I go to
the next page,

33
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,160
you see here it says comma.

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,900
Then you can change
the delimiter.

35
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,820
We have different top space

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,190
or if it's semicolon.

37
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,825
So if I change this to,

38
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:36,935
let's say semicolon,

39
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:38,345
you see how it looks like.

40
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:42,320
And then also for
the string makers.

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,790
So this file software
automatic detected it.

42
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,980
Double quoted string maker,

43
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,620
if you have no
string may cake and

44
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,290
just change it to
non or single quote.

45
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,640
So if you have

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,105
trouble reading a
file or you see,

47
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:01,385
you just see
something wierd,

48
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:05,390
let's say like there's
just try to change

49
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,920
their either delimiter or

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,050
the string maker to

51
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,345
just get the right format.

52
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:14,210
So I get a preview of

53
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,910
actuaries, top 18 roles.

54
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,690
I can see that I have
bunch of columns,

55
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,980
mostly demographic
information with

56
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,500
some additional information

57
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,610
like capital gain,

58
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,130
number of product,
capital loss.

59
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,025
And I click next
in this page, I,

60
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:37,030
I, I get to select
the variables.

61
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,330
So if there is any variable

62
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,370
you don't want to import,

63
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,605
you can just put
them in there,

64
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:46,070
not selected area which
is clicking them.

65
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,755
Or if you have
hundreds of columns.

66
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:52,055
And let's say here I have

67
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:53,840
everything in the
not selected area

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,460
under like so many columns.

69
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,025
You can always click
this binocular

70
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:01,550
and then sort the
columns by name.

71
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,085
And then a start
clicking what you need.

72
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:05,720
You just need to hold down

73
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,420
the Control key and
just select them.

74
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,650
And then once, say,

75
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,840
okay, they're highlighted.

76
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,550
And then you
can put them in

77
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,180
the selected area for
this demonstration.

78
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,280
I'll just keep everything.
I'm not gonna.

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,990
I'll just import
all the columns.

80
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,150
And then in the
next wizard,

81
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,025
I'll get the option.

82
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,510
I have several
option actually,

83
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,975
so I can change that
target type, data-type.

84
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:37,705
So for example,
for customer ID,

85
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:40,255
it's always recommended to

86
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:43,270
change that to a
string format or text.

87
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,195
So if I click on the Type,

88
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:47,605
I get a drop-down.

89
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:49,030
I can modify.

90
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,470
Well, let's say if you have

91
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,195
a data file and
you want to just

92
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:55,495
change it to a
specific format.

93
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:57,130
You can just do it to

94
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,980
this setTimeout
timestamp menu

95
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,860
and you get options
to modify things.

96
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,860
Then you see this
sampling on the top.

97
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,020
So if you are trying to,

98
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,760
let's say you're just doing

99
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,070
some exploration on
this data and you don't

100
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,580
want to import
everything into

101
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,560
knowledge is studio you
want to just import

102
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,020
the top thousand rows.

103
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,170
You can always pay
top and records

104
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,475
or a percentage of

105
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,740
records or just
number of rec,

106
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,820
or let's say I just want to

107
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,935
import 200 drug courts

108
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:34,010
randomly import 200 records

109
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,600
into knowledge is studio.

110
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,350
For this demonstration.

111
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,330
Again, I want to keep
all the records.

112
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,480
I'm importing everything.
If you want to.

113
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,950
Again, let us say if you

114
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,415
modify the type of data,

115
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,810
let's say a date.

116
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,390
You already have it as
timestamp and you want

117
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,405
to cut the time.

118
00:04:56,405 --> 00:04:58,580
So only keep the
date portion of

119
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,030
that timestamp
variable, for example.

120
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,505
And you want to see if
you did it correctly.

121
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,970
You can always say show
data and then click

122
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,440
refresh and you get

123
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,770
a preview of what
you've done soul,

124
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,530
if you, you can see
the result technically

125
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,250
when you modify
the target type.

126
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,370
You also speak a column
called precision.

127
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,080
So if the value is 0,

128
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,155
it means that you want
to keep everything.

129
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:31,230
Let's say specific
lipid numeric columns.

130
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,960
If you want 13
decimal points,

131
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,190
let's say you have

132
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,140
ten decimal points
and you want to

133
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,330
just keep two
decimal points,

134
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,820
then you just change
it, let's say to,

135
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,125
to, to keep the
decimal part.

136
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,215
If you want to round to 13,

137
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:56,540
let's say around it to 200,

138
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,850
you just used a
negative number.

139
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,400
So just say, let's
say if you want

140
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,350
to round 278 to,

141
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,224
let's say show 300,

142
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:11,415
you just use minus two.

143
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:16,130
And then it rounded up
to the nearest 100th.

144
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,010
That's about precision.

145
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,110
Or just keep it at 0,

146
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,565
just to keep everything.

147
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:27,145
Because I, usually
when I import data,

148
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:29,990
I don't modify
anything first.

149
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,485
Because they want
to take a look

150
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:34,570
at my data as

151
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,310
raw as possible
first and then

152
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,290
I'll go back and
modify things.

153
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,760
Again. If you forget

154
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,170
to change any target type,

155
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,400
you can always go back to

156
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,370
this wizard and
changed the types.

157
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,455
And you also have

158
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:49,360
other options to change

159
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,490
the type of
variables later on.

160
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,920
So don't worry if
do you ever forget

161
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,700
to like modify things
or they import time.

162
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,700
It's just so easier.

163
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,470
And then I can click run.

164
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,690
So now I've
imported my data.

165
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,480
I'll just quickly
open it so you

166
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,240
can just double-click on,

167
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,610
on this green circle
to open the data,

168
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,030
we'll all just right-click
and open view.

169
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,355
And then you get this view.

170
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:24,860
I just wanted to see
if my customer IDs

171
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,320
actually string now
and I can confirm

172
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,795
that it was changed from

173
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:35,429
an numeric type
to string. Right.
