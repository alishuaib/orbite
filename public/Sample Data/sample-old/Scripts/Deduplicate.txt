DEDUPLICATE

In this demonstration we will illustrate how to deduplicate or get rid of duplicate values.

Letâ€™s use the Base Demographics dataset, for this demonstration we will use our aggregate demo workflow.

First, we need to remove duplicate rows.

Drag a Deduplicate node onto the canvas.

Connect the Base Demographics dataset.

Double click to open the wizard.

Give the target dataset an appropriate name and click run.

Double click the output.

Here, we can see that 194 duplicate rows were removed alongside the number of rows left.

Lastly, we want to Join both, our transactional and demographic datasets into one complete dataset.

Drag a Join node onto the canvas.

Connect both output datasets from the Aggregate and Deduplicate nodes.

Double click to open the wizard.

Select the field to use to match records, in this case ID.

Click next.

Set an appropriate name for the new dataset.

We will keep the default join method to include matching records only.

Click next.

Select the fields to include from the first dataset and click next.

Select the fields to include from the second dataset and click next.

Review the selected fields and click run.

Double click on the output dataset.

We can see that all 554 records from our transactional dataset were found in the demographics dataset.

Viewing the data tab, we can also see that each customer ID is now associated with various demographic fields as well.
