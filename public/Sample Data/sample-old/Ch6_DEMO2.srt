1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,785
Now, let's connect
the census data

2
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:09,105
to variable
transformation node.

3
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,710
And let's open the variable

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,035
transformation known.

5
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:16,080
We talked about this
missing percentage

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,580
of missing value column.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,305
If I just click this,

8
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:21,735
it generates that for me.

9
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:23,925
I can see that I have

10
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:26,745
some missing values
in capital gain.

11
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:28,890
Now, if I want to,

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,675
let's say, add a field,

13
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:33,645
and let's say I want
to look our transform,

14
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:38,280
the capital gain,
just click Add Field.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,410
And by default, it gives
this filled 15 name.

16
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,155
But I can just rename
it and I call it

17
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:49,370
like log capital gain.

18
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,280
Okay? And I don't know how

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,755
to do the log
transformations,

20
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,435
so I'll go to function.

21
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:57,919
When I click functions,

22
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:00,589
you see bunch of
functions, categories,

23
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:03,410
math, general
string, aggregate,

24
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,090
and so on to math function

25
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,170
that I'm looking for.

26
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,945
And there are a bunch
of them listed here.

27
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:12,440
And then I select,
for example, Locke.

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,335
All right, so when I
double-click on it,

29
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:18,140
it somehow gives me
the information.

30
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,860
So inside the bracket
you see it says

31
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,315
log transformation
accept a flow value

32
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:27,680
has to be numeric.

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,314
I can't log transform

34
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:32,150
the education
variable, for example.

35
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,860
But I want to do
capital gains.

36
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,930
So now I can,

37
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,255
if I already know
what the name of

38
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:40,865
the column is
with proper name,

39
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,380
I can just type it.

40
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,805
But if I don't,

41
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:47,315
I can always go to
this list of columns.

42
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,860
I just click on
this columns

43
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,000
here and shows me

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,330
the list of variables
I have in my data set.

45
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,040
And then I choose capital

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,280
K. Remember my cursor

47
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,050
was inside the brackets.

48
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,060
So when I click
this capital a,

49
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,145
it automatically
keeps back.

50
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:07,070
Maybe I say plus one.
And why is that?

51
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,050
Because they have
so many nulls in

52
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,420
capital gain log of null,

53
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,710
I don't get an erasure,

54
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,555
so I'll just say plus one.

55
00:02:14,555 --> 00:02:16,115
So at least, sorry,

56
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:17,900
it should be
insight at this to

57
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,530
get the 0 value anyway.

58
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,680
And then I force data
to be instantiated.

59
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,125
So if I don't do
that, the lake in,

60
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,910
on this, the actual column

61
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,155
doesn't get created.

62
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:32,735
Only this formula is

63
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,480
going to be kd over
with my datasets.

64
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,890
So I always like

65
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,740
to force data to
be instantiated.

66
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,760
Again, it depends on how

67
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,684
much disk you
huh, available.

68
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:45,139
And then I click Validate,

69
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,780
it's okay, it works fine.

70
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,460
And I click OK, right?

71
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,560
So this is how I create

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,210
a new column to my dataset.

73
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,660
Now, let's say I
wanted to apply

74
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,480
this log transformation to

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,790
both capital gain
and capital loss,

76
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,470
but I don't wanna
do it twice.

77
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,585
What could I have done?

78
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:10,880
Could have done.
I could have

79
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,340
gotten to this
transform fields.

80
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,290
And here you see the
expression area.

81
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,210
It says selected fields,

82
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,725
so it applies

83
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:25,070
whatever expression
I want into.

84
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,140
A list of columns that a

85
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,090
select in the
selected area.

86
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,770
So I pick capital gain,

87
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,670
capital loss, put it
in the selected area.

88
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,810
By default, it
takes the name of

89
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,360
the actual column
and add the prefix

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,150
of x, PR,
underscore, tweet.

91
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,920
If you want to modify this,

92
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,915
please go ahead and do so.

93
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:49,940
You can, you can
either choose

94
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,620
prefixed are
actually suffix.

95
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,155
It can change the suffix,

96
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:56,300
prefix, whatever
works for you.

97
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,280
Again, I would like to say

98
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,590
cross theta to
be instantiated.

99
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,810
And then here I say, OK,

100
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,900
maybe do this, sorry,

101
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:11,290
log transform on both

102
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,860
of these files and
both of these columns.

103
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,345
Click validate.

104
00:04:16,345 --> 00:04:19,465
It tells me that. Span it.

105
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:22,630
Click OK. And you see how

106
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,230
these two columns
got created.

107
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,035
So by just writing
one expression,

108
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,030
I applied the
same expression

109
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,365
into multiple columns.

110
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:35,275
That's about
transform field.

111
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,335
Let's go back to
this capital gain,

112
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:40,900
just log capital gain
or they created,

113
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,105
if I go back to edit field,

114
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:45,895
and let's say that

115
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:50,085
I want to use a
specific function,

116
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:53,195
but I don't know
what the syntax is.

117
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:57,170
There's this syntax help
bitches, hyperlink.

118
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,015
You can just click on it.

119
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:00,680
This Hayes shows you

120
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,660
all the syntaxes
that domain is.

121
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,205
So for example, if

122
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:06,545
you want to
modify a string,

123
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:08,150
you just click on
this a string.

124
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,860
It gives you all
the functions

125
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,940
we have available.

126
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,120
And let say you want
to apply our dream,

127
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,475
which is trim spaces

128
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:19,700
of specific texts
from the right side.

129
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,410
So remove their spaces.

130
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,110
So if I don't know
what the syntax is,

131
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,480
I go here or again,

132
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,760
I'll scroll all the
way to the top.

133
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,245
I'll go to general.

134
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:33,335
I don't know how to
write a case statement.

135
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:36,920
Case. And then here
I have an example to

136
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,255
see how the Syntax works.

137
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:45,185
Alright? So a lot of
functions are available.

138
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:47,450
Yeah, I never had issues

139
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,980
like finding something that

140
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,030
they need in here.

141
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,815
Mostly straightforward.

142
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:54,770
So here I created
these three variables.

143
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,960
Now, the other thing,

144
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,430
there's actually easy aside

145
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,220
from writing
expression myself,

146
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,520
let's say I click
this Add Field and I

147
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,975
want to create

148
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:09,035
a new variable
call relationship.

149
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,700
And I at number

150
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,650
two to it because
I want to create

151
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,020
a different
binning structure

152
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,720
for my variable
relationship.

153
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,420
And if I, if I already know

154
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,065
all the categories and
how I want to bin it,

155
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:27,335
I can just start writing
my cases statement.

156
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:29,090
But I am usually lazy.

157
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,840
I just go through

158
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,110
this helper menu,
click helper.

159
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,000
And the first option
and the most common.

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,390
Technique that we use

161
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,415
the spinning epic bidding.

162
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:42,880
Again, there are a
bunch of helpers here.

163
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,000
For example, generation
of dummy variables

164
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,210
or even this
lager transform.

165
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,655
You could objects
created at true here,

166
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:54,065
optimal binning power

167
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:57,625
transform substitute
missing values.

168
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,979
Creation of vague variable.

169
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:04,615
Anyway. So I go through
binning and you see

170
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:06,430
first it shows me

171
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,660
the continuous

172
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,700
valuable only if
like relationship.

173
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,860
It doesn't show
here because by

174
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,390
default the helper type

175
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,800
is continuous spinning.

176
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,750
But I'm looking for
a relationship which

177
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,490
is a category variable.

178
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,230
So I choose discrete.

179
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,845
I have the list of all
the string variables,

180
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,435
and I pick relationship,

181
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:28,205
and then I click next.

182
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:29,870
Again, I get this

183
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,215
popular range
editor window.

184
00:07:33,215 --> 00:07:34,895
Now here I say OK,

185
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:37,790
I want to combine
husband and wife

186
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,945
and group them and
call them married.

187
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:46,295
And then I have
these other ones.

188
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:53,220
I group them and
call them Other.

189
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,700
And then the last one is

190
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,245
just itself on married.

191
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:59,300
I'm not going to touch it.

192
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,300
And I click and you

193
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,970
see how it creates
the quote for me.

194
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,160
So casement relationship in

195
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,890
husband and wife and
married and so on.

196
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,150
So it create, it generates

197
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,150
the code for me when
I click Finish,

198
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,630
already pasted in
my expression area.

199
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,690
And again, for theta
to be instantiated,

200
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,655
you don't need
to do duties.

201
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:25,850
I'm just used
to it so much.

202
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:30,290
And by the way, if you
want to look at data,

203
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,810
you can just kick
that showed a top,

204
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,285
bottom and then refresh

205
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:38,270
to make sure that
you've like this.

206
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,970
Like what do we get out
of this expression?

207
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,615
So tells me that the
first row becomes Other.

208
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:45,680
So you make sure

209
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,750
that you get what
you intended to.

210
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,900
Alright? So I say, okay,

211
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,970
and again here we

212
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,800
have the option
of data preview.

213
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,390
Again, you can
click always show

214
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,865
data, refresh.

215
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:04,985
And now it shows me
the entire data.

216
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:06,860
With data malleable.

217
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,260
That's about binning.

218
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,645
Let's do substitute
missing values.

219
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:16,160
So by again I add
field and then I

220
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,920
say capital gain missing.

221
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,320
Alright? And I go to help

222
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,765
her and I choose
substitute missing value.

223
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:31,044
I click next.

224
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:36,160
It says, select a
variable or rate.

225
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,395
I want capital gain.

226
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:40,120
What do you want to replace

227
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,260
the missing values with?

228
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,200
You want to replace
it with mean,

229
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,990
median mode, max means 0,

230
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,260
or you want to create
your custom expression.

231
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,615
I'm saying explain
custom value.

232
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:54,175
So if you want
to, let's say,

233
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,705
assign a code to whoever
capital gain is.

234
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:01,660
Let's say now you
want to serve,

235
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,165
now you want to
assign 9999.

236
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:08,005
You can do so. But
anyway, for this.

237
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:10,330
Case I, for this
demonstration,

238
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,850
I just take the mean.

239
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,140
And then you can
see that how it

240
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,925
creates the case
statement again,

241
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:23,200
when it's now, it
gives me the average.

242
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,620
Otherwise it just keeps
the original value.

243
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,475
So that's four bobsled,
two missing value.

244
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:36,190
So you can create that
vague variable here,

245
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,685
true helper options,
say my dataset.

246
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:42,490
Remember that I
didn't have equaled

247
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,790
portion on male and
female categories.

248
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,530
But my hope is

249
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,930
to create a wait
for that variable.

250
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,640
So my expression
type is weight.

251
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,285
And I say I choose
the effects variable.

252
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:58,850
And then this is the
proportions right

253
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,230
now, 33% versus 66%.

254
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,140
My geologist choose
the percentage.

255
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,820
Let's say if you
want to create

256
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,175
equal portions,

257
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:13,790
you just assign
50-50 percent weight

258
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,470
to each category and then

259
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,375
it generates the
number for me.

260
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,890
So for each record
with sex in female,

261
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,890
they get 1.51 versus

262
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,800
males that got almost 0.75.

263
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,050
And I'll just
call this weight.

264
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:38,150
Okay? And then I
click OK. Now I've

265
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,515
created a bunch of

266
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:44,510
new variables to my
existing dataset.

267
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:49,250
I click Run census one
as my output data.

268
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,225
No CDs are all my
new variables.

269
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:55,340
Or go to the Data tab,

270
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,770
let's just ignore
some of these.

271
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,315
These are my new
variables like

272
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:04,010
log transformation of

273
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,250
capital gain or
capital loss.

274
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,835
Relationship.
Number two, also,

275
00:12:10,835 --> 00:12:12,845
this person,
customer ID number

276
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:14,360
four is husband.

277
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,010
But now I have
this new group.

278
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,210
I've put him, put them

279
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,895
under married capital gain,

280
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:21,470
like here is no,

281
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,675
but the capital
gain, this column,

282
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,370
I replace null with

283
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,879
the average of capital
gain in my dataset.

284
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,680
So every null, all of

285
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,355
the knowledge
replace with 1354.

286
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:36,590
And then this weight sex.

287
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,780
So how do I use
this weight?

288
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,460
This is my
original data set.

289
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,150
So I look at the sex or
go to Dataset chart.

290
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:49,445
I have 33% versus 66.

291
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:52,740
I'll just put
it on the site.

292
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,325
All right, now, if
I choose paychecks,

293
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,920
I see this thing is

294
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,030
just the frequency
again, similar.

295
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,980
Now on the top you

296
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,575
see there is this
weight option.

297
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:12,725
If I open the dropdown,

298
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,880
I see the list of all

299
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,835
numeric values in my data.

300
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:19,800
I choose weight sex.

301
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,655
Now, I go back to

302
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:26,435
my x variable and you
see what happens.

303
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:28,730
So it applies the weight

304
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,335
to my entire data set.

305
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:32,989
Now when I look at that
specific variable,

306
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:36,619
I can CDs qual portion.

307
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,645
And then there's this way

308
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:42,280
toggle that is on,
on my datasets.

309
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,140
So even I, if I
close the dataset,

310
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,185
that way toggle remains on.

311
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:49,790
It's in opposite with

312
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,890
filter toggle
cause for filter,

313
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,500
when you're, when
you close a dataset,

314
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,855
it turns off automatically.

315
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:58,220
Next time you open it,

316
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,045
you want to make sure that

317
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:00,140
turns on the filter.

318
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,770
If you're planning to
look at the filter,

319
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,590
DID about four
weight, it remains.

320
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,890
And the reason is that
if you use a weight,

321
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,310
especially when you
technically for modeling

322
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,555
and you feed a modeling
node with data set,

323
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,835
then that modelling
nor knows that

324
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:23,810
this dataset is weighted
and then use it.

325
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,120
So that's the whole point

326
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,010
of having this toggle.

327
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,035
So if you want to,
if you turn it

328
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,005
on the modeling node,
nodes automatically,

329
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,180
otherwise like even
if you turn it off,

330
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,490
you can still go
manually inside

331
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,395
the modern Romania Liao

332
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,795
and apply the
weight valuable.

333
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:45,290
But this is just to
show you how to create

334
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,805
weight variable using

335
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:49,560
variable transformation.
