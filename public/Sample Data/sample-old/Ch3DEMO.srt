1
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,935
Okay, so when you

2
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:10,755
open your knowledge
is studio,

3
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:13,845
I should be able to see
something like this.

4
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:15,540
And again, you can

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,020
have multiple versions
on your machine.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,375
Versions doesn't
really interfere.

7
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,340
I select Run, I go to

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,760
my homepage and I start
typing pork station.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,380
You see I have
like two version

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,895
not to just do your work

11
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:34,590
as version 20.120
and then 2820.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,600
Again, I always
recommend using

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,265
the latest version because

14
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:39,840
in the latest version,

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,860
prefix box and there

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,810
are always new and
it will feature.

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,280
So this is the
welcome page.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,975
If you don't want
to see this page,

19
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:50,629
you can uncheck
this option.

20
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:54,815
Display this welcome
screen. Each time.

21
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:57,380
Anyway, I like to see
it because it shows me

22
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,240
my most recent working

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,355
directories that are used.

24
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:03,140
And on the left
side you see

25
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,960
your project pain.

26
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,015
And this is my
working directory.

27
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:09,739
To set your
working directory,

28
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,780
you'll go to File and

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,910
you set your
working directory.

30
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,780
Oranges hit Control
W. And here you

31
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,550
can just choose
wherever you want

32
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,980
to create your
working directory.

33
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,640
I've just created
folder called training.

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,104
So just continue working
in this directory.

35
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:32,525
I don't have any project
in this directory.

36
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,740
Let me just quickly
show you what is this.

37
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,885
So if I go to my
document and then I

38
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:47,450
go to this closure here,

39
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,280
that's my training folder.

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,510
So it's just simply

41
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,400
a fall live in a
working directory.

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,125
And now I'm going to start

43
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,150
creating a project does

44
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,500
how you can start

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,930
working and build
your workflow.

46
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,865
So I just go to File,

47
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:03,530
click Create,

48
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,215
project, or you can
just hit control and,

49
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:08,630
or you can just
click this icon,

50
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,980
this little icon,

51
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,835
the third one
in the toolbar.

52
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:16,850
And then you get a
pop-up saying that,

53
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,890
what do you want to
call this project?

54
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,695
You can choose any name

55
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:24,275
or you just use
the default name.

56
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:25,820
I just used the
default name

57
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,305
which is project one.

58
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,195
And I click okay.

59
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:31,460
So a project gets

60
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,590
created and at
the same time you

61
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,730
see now in

62
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,550
my working directory,
you'll be training.

63
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,935
I have this project one.

64
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:44,405
So it's just a folder.
Going to clubs.

65
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:46,790
Okay. I personally,
first thing I do,

66
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,695
I just turn on this greed.

67
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:50,795
I, I like it very much.

68
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:54,410
And then this is the
search menu on the top.

69
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,520
Let's say if I say

70
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,915
logistic regression
is just for,

71
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,250
once I start typing,

72
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,695
gives me this logistic
regression model.

73
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,645
And then once they selected

74
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,520
this pilot opens up,

75
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,130
the logistic regression
gets highlighted.

76
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,115
I can just place
it on my canvas.

77
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,439
You see that it's gray

78
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,485
and it's this dot is red.

79
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:20,090
It means they doesn't have

80
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,280
the requirement to be open.

81
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,890
So if I click on it,
I can't open it.

82
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,630
If I right-click on it.

83
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,920
I don't know how I don't

84
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,150
see any available option

85
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,390
except removing the
node or adding comment.

86
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,130
We just removed
n naught and

87
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,185
everytime we're gonna
remove nano together,

88
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:38,120
this popup
message reminding

89
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,310
you that if you're short
to remove the note,

90
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,705
because once you delete it,

91
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:44,780
it's gone, you can
bring it back.

92
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,280
First thing I want
to do, I want to

93
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,490
import a file so I
can use this file,

94
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,150
import, drag it,
and put on canvas.

95
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,750
The other option is that
I can right-click in

96
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,280
going through the
pilot or just

97
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,265
right-click anywhere
on the canvas.

98
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:03,620
And you see the
list of pilots.

99
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,480
Pilots or connect.

100
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,615
Profile is just,

101
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,390
you can go to the
menu and see what

102
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,835
you have available
and just selected.

103
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:17,900
So I can say File
Import and just

104
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,490
put that note on

105
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,535
the canvas and open
the viscera. For me.

106
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:24,830
The search is also
available here,

107
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,900
so I can just
click search and

108
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,260
this little search bar
appears on the canvas.

109
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,380
So I can just say File.

110
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,000
And then I see the
list here, phi import.

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,460
It shows me
everything with it.

112
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,630
Thevenin, anything
related to profile,

113
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,195
palette, it
shows up anyway.

114
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:51,200
Just pick File, Import,
ethnic shows up.

115
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,750
It opens up their
visit for me.

116
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,280
And again, if I need

117
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,965
help filling out
this result.

118
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,120
This result is pretty

119
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,230
straightforward and easy,

120
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,775
but in general,
you can just,

121
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,830
this is the thing
that I talked about.

122
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,825
You can just click Help.

123
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:09,350
It opens upon my
other screen and

124
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,430
then it shows me
the file import.

125
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,485
Health related, huh?

126
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:26,780
Okay. So let's just
import something.

127
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,775
So while I'm in this
file import menu,

128
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,920
you see the first thing you

129
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,875
can choose is
the file type.

130
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,875
I have bunch of file
types available.

131
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,410
You can import
from text or CSV,

132
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:49,280
Excel, KDD if
angles format data.

133
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,455
So let's say if
you already have

134
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:56,270
a different project
and you created

135
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,590
some data set and

136
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,690
that data set leaves
in the angles and you

137
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,360
haven't x lives in

138
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,830
the knowledge a studio
and you haven't

139
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,290
exported that data set

140
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,000
into a different format,

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,770
let's say text or Excel.

142
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,740
That dataset isn't
KDD form and you can

143
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,265
just import it into
a different project.

144
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:18,695
That's where you use KDD.

145
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:21,330
I'll show you how.

146
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,990
If you have any R
type or data type,

147
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,660
you can also
export those into.

148
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,535
Knowledge is studio.

149
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:33,875
Once it gets so important,

150
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,344
once it gets imported,

151
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:38,255
then turns into
a KDD data set.

152
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:40,730
Alright. And you can

153
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,400
import different
SAS type data

154
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,710
or SPSS from a species
native or portable.

155
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,880
I don't know what
the difference

156
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,230
between these two is,

157
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,105
but anyway,

158
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:55,669
these are the type of
files you can export.

159
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:58,640
Less juice, just text.

160
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,580
And then let's import,

161
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,300
let's say census dot TXT.

162
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,440
Or if you have
a CSV format.

163
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,670
We can also do that.

164
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's just do a TXT.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,115
Let's just import TXT.

166
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:23,120
Doesn't matter. All right.

167
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,455
I'm going to go through the

168
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:25,820
desert later for now.

169
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,389
I just want to, without
doing anything,

170
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:33,000
I just want to import
so I click run.

171
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,845
So now you see that this,

172
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:38,450
it used to be red dot,

173
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,805
now it turns into green.

174
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:42,365
And I have an output,

175
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:44,045
it's a green circle.

176
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:47,090
Any green circle
legacy on a workflow.

177
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,310
It, It's a dataset.

178
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:55,655
Okay? Any square node
is just a function,

179
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,460
like a function
either model

180
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,245
or a transformation.

181
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:03,860
But a green circles
are actually dataset.

182
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,550
Now, there are other things

183
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,600
in this connect pilot,

184
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,165
for example, dataset link.

185
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:14,555
If I want to, let's say,

186
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:21,440
create a second workflow
for doing data prep.

187
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,910
For example. I want to
use this census data.

188
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,890
So there are different
options to bring

189
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,445
this census data set
into this other tab.

190
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:35,615
I can choose or use
this dataset link.

191
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,120
So just put it
on the canvas

192
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,214
and just double-click
and I find the source.

193
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:46,610
Okay? And you see
that it just opens up

194
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,370
this project one exist

195
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,820
in the training
working directory.

196
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,250
And you see that I

197
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,370
talked about
this KDD format,

198
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,560
every data set, every green

199
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,735
circle in
knowledges studio.

200
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:04,850
If a k KDD format is

201
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,350
just an knowledges
stood your format data.

202
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,000
So if I want to

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,160
point into that
specific data,

204
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,130
so they just select this
KDD formats sensors

205
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,130
dot KDD, Catholic open.

206
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,130
So this is just a pointer

207
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,160
to where senses
dot KDD exits.

208
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,290
You don't make
multiple copies of

209
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,630
same data set,
just step pointer.

210
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,435
And you can also do
this with models.

211
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:36,500
So we have this model
link. So same thing.

212
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,580
So if you, let's
say you have

213
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,630
a decision tree in

214
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,610
a different project
and you want to

215
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,800
bring it into this project.

216
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,920
You can use these link No,

217
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,585
just to point to where

218
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:49,985
that model or
data set exist.

219
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:51,590
You can also bring

220
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,050
model from
external sources.

221
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,530
Let's say if you have
the PML model in

222
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,445
a PMMA format
or XML format,

223
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:02,300
as long as they

224
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,710
have that modelling
technique.

225
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,120
So if, if we don't have

226
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,230
that modelling technique in

227
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,790
knowledges stood,
you can't.

228
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,175
Imported. But let's
say if you have

229
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:13,535
logistic regression
in a PMO Mel format,

230
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:14,480
let's say we created

231
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,060
a logistic regression in R,

232
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,039
then converted it to PMMA.

233
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,600
You can bring it
into knowledge

234
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,265
is studio and
start using it.

235
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:25,850
If you have data
sitting on,

236
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,160
let's say your SQL
Server, I knew going up,

237
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,475
you want to pull it into
knowledge is studio.

238
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:35,315
We can use this
ODBC Import node

239
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:37,130
and then you can
start importing

240
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,140
data into knowledge
is studio,

241
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,960
that's about
connect palette and

242
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,175
this other thing like

243
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,530
import data set
from knowledge hop.

244
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,030
Again, I talked about

245
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,710
a knowledge hub is a
different software.

246
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,680
It's web-based, Let's
say in future if you

247
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,090
use knowledge hub and you

248
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,130
built some
dataset in there,

249
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,690
and you want to
just imported in

250
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,405
knowledge studio because
this is desktop.

251
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,895
Knowledge hop is
a web-based data

252
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,380
sitting is in clouds.

253
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,180
Do you want to import
it? You can use

254
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,720
this specific node
to bring data over.

255
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,225
And then the other thing,
the other function,

256
00:11:11,225 --> 00:11:13,550
easy like is it
youth functionality

257
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,010
is imagine that you

258
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,530
don't wanna use this
link data set node,

259
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,760
but you already created

260
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,430
this new workflow which
is called data prep.

261
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,230
And now you want to put

262
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,210
a pointer to
this dataset on

263
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,830
this other workflow that's

264
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,240
called Data Prep can just

265
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,500
right-click and say link
on another workflow.

266
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,765
And then you
get a drop down

267
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:38,750
or whatever
workflow available.

268
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,985
In the project number one,

269
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:43,265
I only have one
workflow additional

270
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:46,190
For Data Prep,
right-click or pen.

271
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,320
You see that I have

272
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,960
another pointer to census.

273
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,765
This workflow will just

274
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:56,970
click link on
another workflow.

275
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,340
And I say data prep.

276
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,370
And now the second workflow

277
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,490
opens up and it
shows me that,

278
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,400
you know, as I said,

279
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,035
you can just comment.

280
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:16,100
But I can say this is

281
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,730
the census data and I

282
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,770
can say call it step one.

283
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,880
This is how you can
comment your workflow.

284
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Now, wanting to be a very,

285
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,590
let's say, I want
to delete this.

286
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,030
Like I don't want
three copies

287
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,680
of sensors on
this workflow.

288
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,490
You just right click
and I say remove note.

289
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,030
It asks me if I'm
sure to delete it,

290
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,215
I can just click.

291
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:50,290
Yes, they get disappeared.

292
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:55,330
But if I check this option,

293
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,550
says delete the
underlying object

294
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,845
from the project explorer.

295
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,580
And if I check this,

296
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,925
they complete completely
remove sensors

297
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:10,825
from a project number
one so that KDD fine,

298
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:13,184
will be remove and
you get this warning.

299
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:15,620
If I click Yes.

300
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,085
That green circle
removes sensors now is

301
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:25,510
gray because it
points to this place,

302
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,370
which is census dot KDD,

303
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,980
but K sensors
that KDD doesn't

304
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,280
exist says fail
to find a source.

305
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,690
So make sure when you
are deleting data set,

306
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,220
if you don't want
and you want

307
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,365
to create a space
on your desk,

308
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:43,450
you check that option.

309
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,745
But you should be
very careful because

310
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:47,200
if you use data specific

311
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,280
datas at somewhere else,

312
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,245
let's say even in a
different project,

313
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:53,590
once you delete the
source, it's gone.

314
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,190
You see that here, it
becomes grey again.

315
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,330
Anyway. So that's
the thing to keep in

316
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,210
mind or ice the

317
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,950
let me just show you
this other thing.

318
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,600
You said that I,
if I just select

319
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,405
these two nodes
at the same time.

320
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,430
So I can select
bunch of notes

321
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,920
together than
a right-click.

322
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,335
You can delete them.

323
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,645
I can say remove nodes.

324
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:21,415
I can say make supernode.

325
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:23,920
That's what I just
showed you before.

326
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,920
These are just empty nodes.

327
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,175
I can give that
super node and name,

328
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:34,600
and I can just turn it
into a single node.

329
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,815
I'll put it aside.

330
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:37,375
Let's say if you
don't want to use

331
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,280
a part of your workflow,

332
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,520
but you don't want
I deleted you Ana,

333
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,890
keep it for later or

334
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,240
maybe go back
and look at it.

335
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,410
You can just do it this
way so it's cleaner.

336
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,230
But anyway, I'm going
to remove these nodes.

337
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,865
I don't want
them. All right,

338
00:14:55,865 --> 00:15:00,930
so here is our step
one, importing sensors.
