1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
So now we want to build

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,670
a PCA model or you

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,280
want to get some
principal components.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,695
So let's create a new tab.

5
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:13,005
I'm just going
to call it PCA,

6
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:16,055
then I need datasets.

7
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:18,740
So we talked about that.

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,860
The main point of
using PCA is it's

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,360
just because we have

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,460
some correlated variables.

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,980
There are some
multicollinearity issues.

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,615
But instead of just like,

13
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:31,970
let's say removing
some of them,

14
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,760
I still want to
use those in some

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,340
of those informations
later in my model.

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,050
So instead of deleting

17
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,700
some of the variables
from the model,

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,710
I want to convert
them orally,

19
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,590
combine them to
generate new variables.

20
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,720
So go to the help menu

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,570
and there is this
per sample data.

22
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,715
Just click on that.

23
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:55,040
And then the
third sample data

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,434
is called credit.

25
00:00:57,434 --> 00:01:02,200
All right, So what

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,435
knowledge is Studio
does it create

27
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:07,750
new project called
credit under

28
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,925
some already data on

29
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:11,515
pre-built workflow in it.

30
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:13,450
So what I need from

31
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,970
this workflow is just

32
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,035
these two data sets

33
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,790
training, not
even validation.

34
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,259
I just need the training.

35
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,610
I'm going to delete

36
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,665
this decision tree
because I don't need it.

37
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:28,300
So first thing
I want to do,

38
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm first of all this
with a credit dataset.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,860
So it's not
centered anymore

40
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,010
because for the
PCA, you only,

41
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,739
you can only use
numeric variables

42
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:41,690
to generate
principal component

43
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,640
does using
numeric values in

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,620
the census dataset does

45
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,600
not show any
multicollinearity.

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,905
So that's why I
want to use it.

47
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:51,230
Use a different
dataset to show

48
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,755
you when we face
a co-linearity.

49
00:01:54,755 --> 00:01:57,860
Let's say when we build
regression models,

50
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,409
then I decide
to do some PCA.

51
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,435
Here is my training data,

52
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:04,325
and let's open it.

53
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,410
So I see that I have some,

54
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,720
I have 20 thousand
records with

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,840
29 variable under a
bunch of variables.

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's say that I'm
already familiar

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,490
with my dataset and

58
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,785
I know which I want

59
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:21,470
to include in my logistic
regression model.

60
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,180
So I'm not going
to spend time

61
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,205
like exploring this data.

62
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:27,815
But let's also
see that, right?

63
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,395
I see some missing
values as well.

64
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:32,720
For example, in
this variable age I

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,360
have 2% missing values,

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,925
or let's say
years at address,

67
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,620
I see missing values or

68
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,570
let's say these
other variables,

69
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,860
they all have
missing values.

70
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,960
So I see some percentage

71
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,400
of missing in my data.

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,870
And for some of
the variables,

73
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,745
I'll just keep
that in mind.

74
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:53,390
Now I'm going to build
a logistic regression.

75
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,390
So I take a
logistic regression

76
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,030
from the modelling
pilot query is.

77
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,705
For the dependent variable,

78
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:07,910
there is a field
called the status

79
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,190
to please use that.

80
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,310
It has two categories
but death and okay.

81
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,560
So back that have the,

82
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,795
is the rare
category which I'm

83
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:20,585
going to use for
my prediction.

84
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:22,160
And I just keep

85
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,680
the variable selection
method under

86
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,470
must include all, all
selected variables.

87
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,055
So I'm not going
to use like

88
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:31,130
a stepwise or
other methods.

89
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,230
And then from this list,

90
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,350
see what I need to use.

91
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,930
First of all, I
sort them by name.

92
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,255
And then I'm going to use

93
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:46,985
a average monthly
balance, credit line,

94
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:51,335
recommended line, total
amount purchased,

95
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:53,825
total service
charge, revenue,

96
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:56,510
and years that address.

97
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,910
So these are the
variable that I want to

98
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,905
include in my modern age,

99
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:02,300
average monkey balance,

100
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,895
credit line,
recommend that line.

101
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:08,735
Transaction related
information and data.

102
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:10,595
And these are all numeric.

103
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,410
And I click Okay,

104
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,255
they all gets highlighted.

105
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,369
And then I can
use this icon,

106
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:17,630
the single arrow,

107
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,390
to put them in the
independent variables

108
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,860
selected area.

109
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,310
Okay, then click
Next and run.

110
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,709
Let's open the model.

111
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,350
And let's go to

112
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,750
the currently
selected sequence.

113
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,560
All right, now I
see that I see

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,470
some multicollinearity
issue by

115
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,020
looking at the VIF table.

116
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,330
I see, for example,

117
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,280
average monthly balance has

118
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,590
this seven number and I

119
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,900
also see total service

120
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,555
charge revenue, it's 6.9.

121
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:55,010
Also notice some of these

122
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,050
are not really significant.

123
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,700
You see the p-value,

124
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,545
although I've
got pretty high

125
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,750
entropy explained,

126
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,325
but this is not the model

127
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:06,035
that I'm going to use.

128
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:07,840
Based on the previous
information.

129
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,110
I would just go back and

130
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,670
remove one of
these variable.

131
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,805
But now that I
know what PCA is,

132
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:16,490
maybe I'll give it a
try and see if I can.

133
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,100
Instead of removing
these variables like

134
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,825
average monkey balance or

135
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:23,390
total service charge
revenue are all.

136
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,190
Try to see if I can
convert these into

137
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,110
some components and use

138
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,435
these two in my model.

139
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:31,610
All right, So for now,

140
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,925
I just leave this model
here and then I'm

141
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:38,240
going to build principal
component analysis.

142
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,010
So I drag out of the
training data and I go

143
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,630
to the model and I

144
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,050
choose principal
component analysis.

145
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,590
So again, all we see in

146
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,610
the available fields
are numeric fields.

147
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,884
If you open this
binocular icon,

148
00:06:04,884 --> 00:06:08,230
you see the fish types
are all numeric.

149
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,935
All right, so
what a closer.

150
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:13,840
Again, I'm going to sort

151
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,150
these and I choose h,

152
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,525
average monthly
balance, credit line,

153
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:23,949
recommended line, total
amount purchased,

154
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,180
total service charge,

155
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,735
revenue, and years actress.

156
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:30,729
Once they are selected,

157
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:32,205
they gets highlighted.

158
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:34,625
And I put them
in the selected.

159
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,960
Now remember I talked

160
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,450
about the variance cutoff.

161
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,975
So if you want to
just give this,

162
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:43,955
if you want to include

163
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:46,414
and Phi all the components,

164
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:48,080
all the possible
components,

165
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,315
you can just change
it to a 100 percent.

166
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:52,040
But usually we
don't do that.

167
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,330
It's okay if you give me

168
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,240
just 70% of the variance

169
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,665
of all these variables,

170
00:06:57,665 --> 00:06:59,510
I'm, I'm fine with it.

171
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,340
So the default is 70,

172
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,760
but you can always
increase if you want to.

173
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,290
Maybe I'll just increase it

174
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,000
first so you see what

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,545
the result would
be and then

176
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:11,615
I'll go back and
modify this.

177
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,090
All right, so
just click Run.

178
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,280
It's just one page.

179
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,845
All right, so eye opener.

180
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,960
First of all, I
get a warning that

181
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,820
these many records got

182
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,970
excluded because
of missing values.

183
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,875
And I know that this age

184
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,330
and I believe it was years

185
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,839
at address that I've
got some nulls.

186
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,140
So because correlation
cannot be generated,

187
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,060
then they've got excluded,

188
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,680
arose with the null value.

189
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,420
So that's fine.

190
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,640
Then I go and look
at the scree plot.

191
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,145
So scree plot tells me that

192
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:49,415
I have seven components.

193
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:52,250
Remember I have
seven variables

194
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,570
because I said give me the,

195
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,445
a 100 percent
variance is actually

196
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:58,415
gave me seven components.

197
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,665
But you see where

198
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:04,175
this eigenvalue
curve receiver,

199
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:07,775
it gets very cheap,
like it's right here.

200
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,410
Maybe I should only use

201
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,910
three to four components

202
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,930
because at this point,

203
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,185
if I look at the
cumulative percentage,

204
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,835
I see that I can get

205
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:19,610
the variance if I
just enough variance,

206
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,130
if I just look at the
first four components,

207
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,395
even if I look at the
first three components,

208
00:08:24,395 --> 00:08:26,480
I get above 80 percent

209
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,819
of the cumulative variance.

210
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:31,460
But anyway, or I can
go back and modify

211
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,040
it later to actually
you see the red line.

212
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,675
It's, it's at the very end.

213
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:37,280
It's not a 100 percent.

214
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,980
So once you verify
that cutoff edges,

215
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,055
then you see a
line in the middle

216
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:50,005
wherever it breaks
that cutoff.

217
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:53,335
And then the next tabs
are eigenvectors.

218
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:56,500
So again, because I
have seven variables,

219
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,720
it gives me seven
eigenvectors

220
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,150
with associated
eigenvalues.

221
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,350
But by just looking at

222
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,420
this eigenvalue of
I can see that the

223
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,070
first two gives me

224
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,320
like if I add these two up,

225
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,930
it gets like 4.8.

226
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:16,615
And then if I say for
point a divided by 7,

227
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:18,640
it actually gives
us 68 percent

228
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,450
of information of
all these variables.

229
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,460
I can keep.

230
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,830
The third one is
close to one,

231
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,525
it's very close to one.

232
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,550
Since we say we are

233
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,595
interested in eigenvalues
greater than one,

234
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:34,520
because we expect
eigenvalue to give us

235
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,710
at least
information related

236
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,330
to one of the variables,

237
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,415
at least one unit
of variance.

238
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:42,200
Right away we see
that the other ones

239
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,840
has very small eigenvalues.

240
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,420
Look at.

241
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,435
The last one is just
wrecked nothing.

242
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:48,830
And then these are,

243
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,075
the last type is

244
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:52,220
just a component
coefficients.

245
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,030
So it tells me how the
coefficients also,

246
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,030
by looking at PC one,

247
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,780
I can see the years of
address is actually.

248
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,160
That's high impact.

249
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,750
Actually for most of them,

250
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,640
this one, same thing,

251
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,360
0.025 is the
coefficient for years

252
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,025
that address
also h is 0.02,

253
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:18,995
but Component number
three has the highest.

254
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:21,755
The value of
coefficients are higher.

255
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:27,305
Here is at address
0.09 and age is 0.03.

256
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:27,860
Anyway.

257
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,060
So in order if, if

258
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,470
I want to get rid of these,

259
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,780
fine, I can just
ignore them.

260
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,900
But for now, just to
see what happens,

261
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,330
I'll go back to this model.

262
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,479
Click Modify,
right-click modify,

263
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:45,090
and change this cutoff
to seven meters.

264
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,110
Okay?

265
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,310
So now I have

266
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,540
this a scree plot

267
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,760
telling me that
I should stop

268
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,790
at three components
because they

269
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,420
get more than 70
percent of variation.

270
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,690
You see that those
ones got disappeared.

271
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,790
The additional
one, again, 4567.

272
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,905
And then it's just
like a filter.

273
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:11,620
It gets disappeared
from the list.

274
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,375
How do I use this?

275
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,370
Let's close this.

276
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,550
I take a scoring node,

277
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,620
so I drag out of
this training data.

278
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,415
And then I go to
action and a scoring.

279
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:31,435
And with my PC, PCA model.

280
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:33,370
So I connect my data to

281
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,875
a scoring node and
the PCA model,

282
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,360
darling, I'm happy with it

283
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,970
includes three components.

284
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,670
Let's just give
it a short name.

285
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,740
So here you see that I

286
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,004
have the three components.

287
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:52,465
These are, these
components get

288
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:54,400
calculated and
will be added

289
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,980
to my dataset as a column.

290
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,500
So if I want to
exclude any of them,

291
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,840
let's imagine that I had

292
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,540
that 100 percent cutoff

293
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,000
and I had a list of
seven components.

294
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,050
I would just exclude
them here so many ways.

295
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,670
Just exclude them at

296
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,935
this point I can
modify the name.

297
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:18,335
So let's say if my
first component,

298
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:20,620
let's say it's related

299
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,980
to transactional
transactions.

300
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,910
I just give it
a related name.

301
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,210
Or let's say if my if my

302
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,570
PC number 2 related to,

303
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,730
let's say credit
line or like,

304
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,430
let's say the coefficient

305
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,850
for credit related
variables are like higher,

306
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,955
so I just give it
a better name.

307
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:48,460
And then PC number 3 carry

308
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,785
the information related to,

309
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:53,445
let say demographic I had.

310
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:57,110
Here's an address or age.

311
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,355
So I just call
it demographic.

312
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:05,165
So I can give each
component a new name.

313
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:07,415
So these are just
column names.

314
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:11,510
I can also export
these calculations,

315
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,375
so I can just click export.

316
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,220
And then in a
format would be

317
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,170
XML or plain text.

318
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,720
I just need to pick
a destination,

319
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,050
which this is the
credit project.

320
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,365
I prefer to keep it in
the same project and I

321
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:32,555
call it PCAs expressions.

322
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:35,910
All right, so
just save them.

323
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,760
If I want to edit any
of these calculations,

324
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,575
I can also do that.

325
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:43,240
So let's say you have

326
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,950
this business
rule and you want

327
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,340
to just change it or
modify anything here.

328
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,540
You can also do that.

329
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,000
And then down here I decide

330
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,040
which variables I want to

331
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,665
write in my output dataset.

332
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:01,120
If I'm not interested

333
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,205
in these additional
columns,

334
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:05,080
I can exclude them.

335
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,485
Let's say I don't want
this or this, or this.

336
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:10,345
I just want to keep
the other ones.

337
00:14:10,345 --> 00:14:12,560
And I click Run.

338
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:19,715
All right, now, this
is my score dataset.

339
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,485
When I open it
in the report,

340
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:25,805
I get to see the
PCA expressions.

341
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:28,520
And everything else
is just similar

342
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,190
to what you've seen in
any other data set.

343
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:36,365
I noticed that if I
say calculate, all,

344
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:38,300
look at this piece,

345
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,780
PC principal components,

346
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,520
I see these missing values.

347
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,235
Remember that
I said age and

348
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:49,220
years are some
missing values.

349
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,860
So PCA was unable to

350
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,910
generate the associated
information for them,

351
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,800
So those rules
got excluded.

352
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,570
That's why in the PCA

353
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,700
I also see some
missing values.

354
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,500
The next thing I
want to look at,

355
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,200
I go to correlation.

356
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,660
And I only select,

357
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:16,160
let's say PCA and see
what you can see.

358
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,760
They're not
correlated at all.

359
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,590
So this is just a main
concept behind PCA.

360
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,795
So if I'm going to
use these in a model,

361
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:30,290
it won't cause any
multicollinearity issue.

362
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,540
All right, Now
I want to use

363
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,985
this in, in my model.

364
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:36,965
So how do I do that?

365
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:38,870
So right now in
this data set,

366
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,940
I already have PCAs,

367
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,710
but let's say you and I

368
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,585
use it in future for on a,

369
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:46,655
on a different dataset.

370
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,470
And you only if all
you need to keep

371
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,089
is actually those
expressions.

372
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:51,620
So you need to apply

373
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,050
variable transformation
to the data.

374
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,720
So drag out of the
training data.

375
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,280
Go to manipulate palette

376
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,490
and take a variable
transformation now.

377
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,820
So this dataset does
not have the PCA.

378
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,590
So I'm going to,

379
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,840
I already saved the
expressions for.

380
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,490
I'm going to import
them to click Import.

381
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,700
It's from an
expression file.

382
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,215
And then I referred to
where I saved them.

383
00:16:29,215 --> 00:16:33,590
This XML file.

384
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,255
Once I click Next,

385
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:41,740
I get to see them.

386
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,570
If I want to exclude
any of them,

387
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,340
I can do that at the time.

388
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,160
Again, if I want to rename,

389
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,230
I can also do that.

390
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,000
And then those
three variables or

391
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,470
expression gets added to

392
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,175
my variable transformation
dataset editor.

393
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:02,540
And click Run.

394
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,530
Now I have the students.

395
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,295
I didn't want to use
this scoring data,

396
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,600
although it has the library

397
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,160
because the purpose

398
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,320
of scoring if different

399
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,745
than what we did here.

400
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:24,040
All right, and then

401
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,930
from here I'm
going to build

402
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,300
a logistic regression model

403
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,340
with three new variables.

404
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,554
So I'm going to
this model pilot.

405
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,630
I choose a logistic
regression model.

406
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,760
And I call this maybe PCA.

407
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:54,080
Greg. I choose status too,

408
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,205
and I'm interested in
but that category.

409
00:17:58,205 --> 00:18:00,630
And then

410
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,835
all right,

411
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:13,910
I put them in the
selected area.

412
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,100
And then I run my model.

413
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,930
I'm going to
look at the VIF,

414
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,285
although we
already looked at

415
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:27,065
the correlation
matrix of the PCA,

416
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,970
this should also confirm

417
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,410
that you see all the values

418
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:35,300
of BIF there, R1.

419
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,150
And this is my final model.

420
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,955
But also look at the
entropy explain.

421
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:43,325
It. Dropped a lot.

422
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:45,425
But again, it's balanced.

423
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,610
Maybe this, these are not

424
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,200
the best components.

425
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,210
Maybe I need to

426
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,370
go back and bring
in more variables.

427
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,920
But technically the
goal is when you see

428
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,125
highly correlated
variables and

429
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,165
you don't want to
just delete them.

430
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:03,020
You go on try principal
component analysis

431
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,970
and see if that can help.

432
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,545
You also see the p-value
here is pretty high.

433
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:13,050
But anyway, it's
just a practice.

434
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,095
I also have generate code.

435
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:21,395
If I want to deploy this,

436
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,645
it's only SAS or Python.

437
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,730
Only two options.

438
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,250
It should probably just

439
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,995
generate
expressions for me.

440
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:34,055
These are the
three components

441
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:36,470
that I have, the
Python code.

442
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,995
This is how you build
principal component

443
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:42,335
and how your brand a
principal component

444
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:44,670
analysis node.
