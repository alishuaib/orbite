1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
This data set is the
one that I created,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,070
the different drived

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,325
variable instance.
Number one.

4
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:10,500
What do I want to do is to

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,110
create different Sam
first think I want to

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,830
create is to create
validation and

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,580
training dataset
using partition node.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,500
And I want to go to

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,110
the a random some funding.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,050
So input as this
census number

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,885
one and I start
adding partition.

12
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:32,535
So I say OK at

13
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:37,095
one partition and I
call it training.

14
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:39,800
Going. Use this part,

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,530
this partition for
training purpose.

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,810
And I assign 70% of

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,990
my records to this dataset.

18
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,380
You can also choose
record count if you

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,000
know how many
records you want to

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,175
assign to training
partition.

21
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:59,390
I also add in
another partition.

22
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:06,860
Then validation is
the other partition

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,400
I want to create an
ISI, the other 30%.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,690
And by the way
you see there's

25
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,330
this cylinder that
gets updated based

26
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,070
on what percentage
of data was

27
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,860
you flow training
I assigned 70%.

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,600
It's been colored red.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,970
Means this is
already youth.

30
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,245
I only have this much
available. So I say 30.

31
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,090
And then let's say if I,

32
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,795
if I just say 20 and
then our update this,

33
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:34,460
it still shows me how

34
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,570
many what percentage
of record has left.

35
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,100
Once it gets deactivated?

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,440
If you click on it,

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,750
it gets activated again.

38
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,070
So I'll just change
it to 30% Update.

39
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,230
And by the way, you always

40
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,795
can go to this
preview tower

41
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:55,550
tells you actually how

42
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,200
many records
will be assigned

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,050
to this two partitions.

44
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,940
If you just,
you want to see

45
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,610
how many records are
in each data set.

46
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,290
Or you can also

47
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,505
assign random seed is
just too if you want

48
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,460
to generate the
same partition

49
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,670
every time you rerun
this partition node,

50
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,905
you can just
keep the same C

51
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,885
And that's about it.

52
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:22,925
Go, the output of

53
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:25,520
my partition node
is two dataset.

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,415
The first one,
this validation,

55
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:32,120
has 4,884 record,
which I'm going to

56
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,560
use when I want to

57
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,510
validate my
model in future.

58
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,620
And then the training has

59
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,525
about 11 thousand records.

60
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:42,700
So I can also
use partition,

61
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,755
not for another purpose,

62
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:47,230
flow, the filter Note

63
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,380
that we currently
have, it's a new node.

64
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,820
We didn't have that before.

65
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,220
So I used to use

66
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,390
this stratified
function here to just

67
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,820
filter my data or
so let say if I

68
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,849
say I want a stratified
partitioning,

69
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,320
I start adding.

70
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,830
And I say, okay,
based on education,

71
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,540
I want to create

72
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,540
three different
dataset. All right?

73
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,160
And I don't have the option

74
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,880
of defining expression.

75
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,685
I can just see all the
categories and how,

76
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:23,590
what do I want from
each category?

77
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,955
So first of all, I want to

78
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,085
create a category called,

79
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:32,095
let's say, people with
no high school degree.

80
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,555
So I should probably assign

81
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:39,265
all the records
from tenth grade,

82
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:43,540
maybe 11th grade,
from first to 4,

83
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,695
fifth grade to
sixth grade, 176.

84
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:54,100
And then all of these
records and then all

85
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:00,655
of these I'm going to
keep this preschool 32.

86
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:04,520
All right. So that's
my first partition.

87
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,430
People with no high
school degree,

88
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,490
I create a data set
and call it noise.

89
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,875
Then I create another one,

90
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,125
and I call it high school.

91
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:19,804
So you see that all
these other grades,

92
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:22,370
the available
records becomes 0.

93
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,495
So I don't have
access to them.

94
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:33,935
How come I missed a
lev and just do this?

95
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:36,350
Because they missed 11 in

96
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:43,505
the previous Oh, yeah.

97
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:48,365
637. Just copied
the same number.

98
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:51,740
All right. People with

99
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,200
high school degree
or grade 12?

100
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,530
Maybe they assign
these other ones.

101
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,905
Associate Academic slow CA,

102
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:08,705
79 high school, grads, WOW,

103
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:16,670
5,283 professional

104
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,714
schools, and 35.

105
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:22,670
A step. These
are people with

106
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:27,065
high school degrees I
created or not dataset.

107
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:29,285
And then the last one,

108
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:32,630
I want to keep people with

109
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,624
university degrees
in the same dataset.

110
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:41,240
Cuz I want to do different
analysis on each

111
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,385
of these K, 934.

112
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:49,790
Okay? Now if I
update the cylinder,

113
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,785
see now I have
three groups.

114
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,405
Use all data.

115
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:55,850
If I want to look at
number of records,

116
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,530
I can open this preview.

117
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,820
And it tells me in

118
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,450
each partition how
many records I have.

119
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,025
No high school.

120
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:16,985
1931 high school, 10,565
and the university.

121
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:22,850
Okay, I can close this out.

122
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,290
I get three different
data sets. Some output.

123
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,934
Take unordered
partition, not again,

124
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:38,600
again, using
this a stratify,

125
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,050
if I want to create
a dataset with

126
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,720
equal number of records

127
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,430
for males and females.

128
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,140
So I pick the filled sex

129
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,980
and it shows me

130
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,630
the available
number of records.

131
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,745
So the maximum, maybe I

132
00:06:55,745 --> 00:07:00,030
just take 5
thousand of each.

133
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:07,865
Right? And I call
it equal sex,

134
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:10,200
and I run it.

135
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,615
Now, I've got the
subset of census data

136
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:21,500
which go to this
dataset charts on sex,

137
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,030
I can say I have 5 thousand

138
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,410
records on female and

139
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,740
5 thousand records on made.

140
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,305
So that was
another example.

141
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:37,745
Stratified sample Des
Moines I showed you.

142
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:41,585
And that's about it
says everything about

143
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:48,120
partitioning, random
versus stratified.
