# Orbite - AI Powered Chat Assistant for LMS Systems

This is Orbite! A chat assistant for LMS systems that uses AI to answer questions about course content.

It can understand course content stored in SCORM packages, PowerPoints, Word Documents, PDFs, Subtitles; and use it to answer questions about the course!

## üí≠ Motivation & Problem

The goal of this project is to help your learners get quick answers to their questions without having to search through the content themselves.

Imagine a student is trying to remember how to add custom animations to a PowerPoint presentation after looking at your 100 module course on PowerPoint (Sounds scary üòì).

It would take forever trying to find where the answer may be...

With Orbite they can simply ask "How do I add custom animations in Powerpoint?" and find a answer; not only that, they will also get the source and be directed to it!

AI Powered Chat ü§ù Search - all in one integration!
